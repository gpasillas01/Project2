<h2> What I do</h2>


    <p> I like to keep myself busy at all times. I workout everyday, manage my own aparrel business, and I love taking pictures.</p>
    <p>Having all these tasks to keep up with on my free time keeps me satisfied and gives me the sense of accomplishment. I do this mostly to make sure I am always in a good mood and it offers a different perspective on life. </p>
    <p> I focus on reselling items varying from vintage furniture to clothing on online reseller pages. But my newest investment is my new apparrel line where I create outifts, advertise them, "model" them and ship them all from the comfort of my studio. All stock is locked in my studio so it gets a bit disorganized at times when new inventory comes in.</p>
    <p> I really just like having a lot of things going on for myself as a way to learn from life.</p>
    <p> I like staying motivated and I often seek for difference sources as it is fun to change things a bit once in a while. Like the video below, I find myself thinking about future changes I would like to make.</p>
